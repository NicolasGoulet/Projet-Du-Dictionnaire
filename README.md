# Welcome to the *Projet du Dictionnaire* !

This is a public repo for the *Projet du Dictionnaire*. 

For those interested in running analyses, please read the `data_dictionary.md` (or `data_dictionary.pdf` if you don't have a nice Markdown visualizer on hand), which is the intended documentation for this repo. 

The data for the prompts and the produced graphs can be made available on demand.

*ut nihil non iisdem verbis redderetur auditum*
